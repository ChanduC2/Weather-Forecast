# Weather Forecast
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop an interactive Weather Forecast Dashboard that leverages real-time data from a weather API to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather insights. The dashboard aims to present current conditions, short-term and long-term forecasts, and historical weather trends through intuitive visualizations. It will enable users to monitor temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and air quality, enhancing decision-making for travel, outdoor activities, and daily planning
